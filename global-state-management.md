# 🌍 Global State Management Libraries for React Native

Managing global state efficiently is crucial in a React Native application. Below are various state management libraries, their pros and cons, and when to use them.

---

## **1️⃣ Context API**
💡 **Best for:** Small apps with minimal state management needs.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Built into React (no extra dependencies).  
- Simple to use and set up.  
- Works well for global app-wide state like theme, auth.  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Can cause unnecessary re-renders if not optimized.  
- Not ideal for frequent state updates (e.g., animations, chat apps).  
- Becomes harder to manage in large applications.

---

## **2️⃣ Zustand**
💡 **Best for:** Medium to large apps needing **performance** and **simplicity**.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Lightweight (~1KB).  
- Minimal re-renders (only updates subscribed components).  
- Simple API (`useStore()`).  
- Supports middleware for logging, persistence, etc.  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Smaller ecosystem than Redux.  
- No built-in async handling (use async/await manually).  
- Lacks built-in dev tools (can integrate with `redux-devtools-extension`).

---

## **3️⃣ Redux Toolkit (RTK)**
💡 **Best for:** Large, complex apps that need structured state and debugging tools.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Standardized and scalable.  
- Built-in async support via **RTK Query** and **createAsyncThunk**.  
- Advanced **Redux DevTools** for debugging.  
- Well-documented and widely adopted.

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Boilerplate-heavy compared to Zustand or Jotai.  
- More setup required (slices, reducers, actions).  
- Can be overkill for small apps.

---

## **4️⃣ Jotai**
💡 **Best for:** Apps needing fine-grained reactivity with a minimalistic approach.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Atomic state model (components subscribe to only relevant state).  
- Minimal boilerplate, easier than Redux but scalable.  
- Supports **async atoms** out of the box.  
- Derived state support without extra selectors.

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux.  
- State isn’t persisted by default (requires `jotai/utils`).  

---

## **5️⃣ Recoil**
💡 **Best for:** Apps requiring **derived state and atomic state management**.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Fine-grained state updates (only re-renders relevant components).  
- Built-in support for derived state and async selectors.  
- Good for apps needing computed values.  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Not officially part of React (developed by Facebook).  
- Smaller ecosystem than Redux.  
- No built-in persistence (needs extra setup).  

---

## **6️⃣ MobX**
💡 **Best for:** Apps needing **observable state** with automatic UI updates.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Reactive state management (automatically updates UI).  
- Less boilerplate than Redux.  
- High performance (only updates affected components).  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Harder to debug due to implicit reactivity.  
- Can lead to unpredictable state updates if misused.  
- Less popular than Redux, fewer community resources.  

---

## **7️⃣ Effector**
💡 **Best for:** **Declarative, high-performance state management**.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Functional and declarative.  
- Optimized for performance.  
- Supports **reactive computations** without unnecessary re-renders.  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- More complex API than Zustand or Jotai.  
- Less community adoption than Redux.  

---

## **8️⃣ Valtio**
💡 **Best for:** Apps needing a **proxy-based reactive state**.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Minimal API and easy to use.  
- Uses **Proxies**, making it highly efficient.  
- Allows **direct state mutation** (like MobX).  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Not as widely adopted as Zustand or Redux.  
- Limited tooling compared to Redux.  

---

## **9️⃣ Overmind**
💡 **Best for:** Large-scale apps needing structured state, actions, and effects.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Built-in debugging tools.  
- Supports derived state and computed properties.  
- Modular and scalable.  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- More complex than Zustand or Jotai.  
- Less community support than Redux.  

---

## **🔄 Should You Use TanStack Query?**
**TanStack Query (React Query)** is not a full state management library but is great for **server state**.

### ✅ **Pros:**  
- Automatic **caching, refetching, and syncing**.  
- Supports **pagination, infinite scrolling, and optimistic updates**.  
- Reduces API-related Redux boilerplate.  

### ❌ **Cons:**  
- Not meant for **client-side state** (like auth, UI state).  
- Requires **manual cache invalidation** in some cases.
